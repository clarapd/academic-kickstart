Welcome to my page! My name is Clara and I am an epidemiologist and researcher working in the Barcelona Institute for Global Health (ISGlobal). I am currently enroled in the PhD programe of the faculty of Medicine of the University of Barcelona, working on my thesis about maternal health in sub-Saharan Africa.

I performed my master thesis in ISGlobal on HIV and socioeconomic status, which was then followed by a professional internship in ISGlobal's Chagas Initiative. In late 2015, I started working in the Maternal, Reproductive and Child Health Initiative as a research technician under the supervision of Dr. Clara Menéndez. Currently, Dr. Menéndez is my PhD supervisor, together with Dr. Raquel González, both experts in maternal health and malaria in pregnancy.

Now, I am a predoctoral fellow in the team actively participating in different clinical trials and research studies. Take a look at the projects' section below!

I hold a FPU predoctoral scholarship from the Spanish Ministry of Education and Vocational Training to perform my thesis, and I got a scientific scholarship in 2019 from the Dexeus Mujer Foundation to carry out a study on adolescents' maternal health in Mozambique.
