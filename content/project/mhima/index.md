MHIMA project aims to assess the impact of HIV infection on maternal morbidity and the prevalence of adverse perinatal outcomes in adolescents and young women from a semi-rural area of southern Mozambique. </br>

This study is a secondary analysis of data obtained prospectively from three clinical trials conducted in the district of Manhiça, southern Mozambique. These trials evaluated the safety and efficacy of antimalarial drugs as Intermittent Preventive Treatment of malaria in
pregnancy (IPTp). </br>

It is expected to determine if being adolescent and HIV-infected increases the probability of suffering from maternal health problems. </br>
