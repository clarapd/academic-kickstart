The fiver-year project Transforming Intermittent Preventive Treatment for Optimal Pregnancy (TIPTOP) aims to sustain and scale up an innovative, community-based approach to expand coverage of intermittent preventive treatment in pregnancy (IPTp) for pregnant women, in four sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) countries (SSA): Nigeria, Democratic Republic of Congo, Madagascar and Mozambique. </br>

The overall project goal is to contribute to reduced maternal and neonatal mortality by expanding access to QA SP for IPTp.  </br>

The Project will establish a scalable model across four countries to generate evidence for change and expand access to preventive chemotherapy for pregnant women. TIPTOP will apply a community-based approach that fosters partnership and strengthens the dynamic link between communities and health facilities, especially for the most vulnerable people. Specifically, a novel platform will be introduced to increase coverage of IPTp3-SP to a minimum of 50% in project areas, across targeted countries, to prevent malaria in pregnancy (MiP).</br>

Accelerating demand for IPTp-SP primarily through Community Health Workers (CHW) will be pivotal in generating reductions in maternal and neonatal mortality. A learning-driven approach will be employed  throughout the project to guide expansion in a two-phase process and generate sufficient evidence to inform WHO policy recommendations and
future actions in each country, in an effort to expand the intervention over the long-term.</br>

The evaluation of the intervention will be based on the measurement across time of the coverage of IPTp through household surveys, anthropological studies on the acceptability of the intervention, and a cost-effectiveness analysis. </br>
