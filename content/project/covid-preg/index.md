It is unclear how SARS-CoV-2 affects pregnant women and their offspring, as well as which factors may influence obstetrical disease and outcomes. As a result, this will be a randomized, double blinded, placebo-controlled multicentre trial aiming to assess the effect of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) in reducing maternal viral load and the efficacy of HCQ to prevent incident SARS-CoV-2 infection. Pregnant women of any gestational age, parity and age, undergoing pre-natal follow up at four maternity hospitals (2 in Barcelona and 2 in Madrid) with a positive PCR test, with our without symptoms of COVID-19 diseases, or who are contacts of a confirmed case and tested negative in the PCR test, will be recruited and randomised 1:1 to receive HCQ orally (400 mg/day for 3 days, followed by 200 mg/day for 11 days) or placebo. Women will be followed up for the duration of the intervention when PCR tests for SARS-CoV-2 will be repeated, and up to delivery, when the pregnancy outcome will be registered, a cord blood sample and a neonatal throat swab will be collected after birth to be tested for SARS-CoV-2.</br>
