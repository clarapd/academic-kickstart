Malaria infection during pregnancy is an important driver of maternal and neonatal health especially among HIV-infected women. In Africa, at least one million pregnancies are co-infected with malaria and HIV annually. Intermittent preventive treatment in pregnancy (IPTp) with sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) is recommended for malaria prevention in HIV-uninfected women but it is contraindicated in those HIV-infected on cotrimoxazole prophylaxis (CTXp) due to potential adverse effects. </br>

This is a randomized double blind placebo-controlled trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of DHA-PPQ for IPTp in HIV-infected pregnant women (n=664) receiving CTXp and ARV drugs and using LLITNs in Mozambique and Gabon where malaria and HIV infection are moderate to highly prevalent. In addition, the possibility for a PK interaction between DHA-PPQ and ARV drugs is being assessed in a sub-sample of participants. Women receive ARV therapy according to national guidelines and their infants will be followed until one year of age
to evaluate the impact of DHA-PPQ on mother-to-child transmission of HIV.</br>
