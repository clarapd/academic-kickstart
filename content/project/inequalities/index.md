The most vulnerable women are not accessing essential health care services and undergo their pregnancies and childbirths outside
the health system. New tools and knowledge are needed to put equity at the heart of all strategies, a pre-requisite to achieve the common set of goals and targets set out by the Sustainable Development Goals. </br>

This study used the most recent data available to analyse 15 opportunities for women of reproductive age (15-49), including two subgroups: pregnant women and older adolescent girls (15-19), within and across 29 sub-Saharan African (SSA) countries. The introduction of new metrics, such as the Human Opportunity Index (HOI), a composite indicator that determines how many opportunities are available (the coverage rate), and how equitably those opportunities are distributed across circumstance groups (sets of individuals with the same characteristics), allows new understanding of the constraints and opportunities to achieving equity in perinatal and reproductive health. The HOI allows simultaneous consideration of different health determinants to assess the magnitude and sources of inequality for different indicators and, thus identify which circumstances are generating the highest inequalities both at a country level and across the SSA region.</br>
